# Garden of Thorns
Garden of Thorns is a 3D roguelite shooter developed by UCF students Asir Alam, Miguel Rosario, Lily Latzo and Axel Lopez for CAP 4053 in Spring 2024.

## What is Garden of Thorns about?

Garden of Thorns is a game where you, the player, take on the role of the Gardener. The Gardener was residing peacefully in the forest when one day, the inhabitants go wild, with all types of creatures seeking combat throughout the land. Your task is to clear room after room of these enemies, gathering items that empower you and your trusty revolver until you can make your way to the golem that stands guard at the end of the forest. Defeat him, and return the forest to normal.

## But what is the gameplay like?
As a 3D shooter, Garden of Thorns takes inspiration from popular titles in the genre such as Risk of Rain 2 and Gunfire Reborn. This means your gameplay revolves heavily around how you can move throughout the rooms with your teleport ability and how well can you aim. But don't worry, various items will drop upon room clear, enabling you to take on more and more enemies as the rooms get intense.
